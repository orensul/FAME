# commonsense-analogy

## Goal
Our main goal is to understand analogy, for example:  

**1) Finding a good man is like finding a needle in a haystack:**  
As Dusty Springfield knows, finding a small needle in a pile of hay takes a long time, so the task at hand is likely to be hard and tedious.  
https://examples.yourdictionary.com/analogy-ex.html  
  
**2) That's as useful as rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic:**
 It looks like you're doing something helpful but really it will make no difference in the end.

**3) DNA replication ~ a train track**  
The DNA is like a train track that gets pulled apart by the train.

**4) paragraph ~ a family**  
A paragraph is like a family. In a family, all the members are related. In a paragraph, all the sentences are related.

**5) Sunscreen protects against the sun just as a tarpaulin protects against rain**

## google engine
This script using the API of google auto-complete the extract information.  
We are using question, subject and object which make the results more detailed.
By default (determine in get_query()) the forms is:  
**{question} {subject} "*" {object}**  
for example: why do horses "*" stables  
&nbsp;  
by default, the script is looking also for the plural and singular forms of the inputs.  
For example, **horses** will convert into **horse** (in addition) and **stables** into **stable**.  
&nbsp;  
in addition, by default, the script is looking for **synonyms**.  
It's taking the **best 5** results according to the word vector comparison.  
more information in dictionary.py section.
```bash
# using default example.yaml file without saving the results into a file
python google_autocomplete.py

# for the following yaml file content:
why do:
  - [horses, stables]

how do:
  - [horses, stables]

# the output will be:
```

&nbsp;  

## quasimodo
This script using quasimodo database, which contains semantic information.  
We are intersting in the following fields: **subject**, **predicate**, **object**, and **score**.  
First, the script cleaning rows with low score. Then, it allow to get information about connections between object.  

```bash
# Download the .tsv file in necessary: 
https://nextcloud.mpi-klsb.mpg.de/index.php/s/Sioq6rKP8LmjMDQ/download?path=%2FLatest&files=quasimodo43.tsv

# usage
from quasimodo import Quasimodo

# heigher score_threshold -> more accurate results, but less amount.
quasimodo = Quasimodo(score_threshold=0.8)

# get all the connections between each pair (connection is subject-object relationship)
quasimodo.get_connections(["sharp", "needle", "knife"])

# so the output will be:  
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/get_connections.png?raw=true)  

```bash
# you can also allow it to be more flexiable with the name by adding soft=True
quasimodo.get_connections(["sharp", "needle", "knife"], soft=True)

# so the output will be:  
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/get_connections_soft.png?raw=true)  

```bash
# get all the common features between few subjects
quasimodo.get_connections_between_subjects(["horse", "cow", "chicken"])

# so the output will be:  
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/get_connections_between_subjects_1.png?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/get_connections_between_subjects_2.png?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/get_connections_between_subjects_3.png?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/get_connections_between_subjects_4_.png?raw=true)  

```bash
# also here you can allow flexiable name by adding soft=True
quasimodo.get_connections_between_subjects(["horse", "cow", "chicken"], soft=True)

# so the output will be:  
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/get_connections_between_subjects_soft_1.png?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/get_connections_between_subjects_soft_2.png?raw=true)

![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/get_connections_between_subjects_soft_4.png?raw=true)  
 
**Note**: by using *soft=True*, the script is just looking for containing word (horse is contain in horse race) and **NOT** looking for synonyms.  
&nbsp;  

## Wikifier
This script is extracting information from a text, such as part-of-speech.  
It using wikifier API for that purpose.  

**Notice**: The tool is ignoring special character inside the text, expect ','  
i.e. the output of "I lo!ve coding??" and "I love coding" will be the same.  

```bash
# usage
from wikifier import Wikifier

text_to_analyze = "I love coding but sometimes coding is very boring"
wikifier = Wikifier(text_to_analyze)
wikifier.get_part_of_speech()

# output:  
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/wikifier_get_part_of_speech2.png?raw=true)  

```bash
text_to_analyze = "sunscreen protects against the sun as a tarpaulin protects against rain"
wikifier = Wikifier(text_to_analyze)
wikifier.get_part_of_speech()

# output:  
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/wikifier_get_part_of_speech1.png?raw=true)  
&nbsp;   

## Synonyms and Antonyms
The script is getting information on a specific word,s such as **synonyms**, **antonyms**, meanings and examples.  
The main use is for synonyms. There are two classes that getting synonyms, *WordNet* and *Dictionary*. And a third class called *Mixed*, which combained both together and taking the best results.
&nbsp;  

The best results are calculate with distance function based on word-vector, using gensim package (https://radimrehurek.com/gensim).  
Because of the use of this package, script that using this file (including google_autocomplete.py) have a long pre-loaing time (aroung 10-20 seconds).
&nbsp;

**notice**: words such as "Equus caballus" or "stalking-horse" that are not contains inside the gensim corups will be ignored.  

```bash
# usage
from dictionary import Mixed

# example 1 
mixed = Mixed('horse')
mixed.getSynonyms()

# output of WordNet: horse, cavalry, knight, buck, sawbuck
# output of Dictionary: horseback, racehorse, pony, chestnut, mare
# and the mixed output:
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/dictionary_best_5_for_horse.png?raw=true)  
&nbsp;   

```bash
# example 2 
mixed = Mixed('increase')
mixed.getSynonyms()

# output of WordNet: decrease, narrow, wane, depreciate
# output of Dictionary: increase, growth, gain, addition, increment
# and the mixed output:
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shaharjacob/commonsense-analogy/blob/main/images/dictionary_best_5_for_increase.png?raw=true)  
&nbsp;  

## metamia randomizer
This site (http://www.metamia.com) has a lot of complex analogy, but a list of all the analogy isn't available (or dataset), but there is a page which return a random analogy (http://www.metamia.com/randomly-sample-the-analogy-database).  
So the script is iterate this page and parsing the analogy, and by that creates a big dataset.  

```bash
# usage (-i is the number of iteration)
python metamia.py -i 100 -o out.csv
```
